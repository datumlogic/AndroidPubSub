TO DO:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Publish screen now works adequately .

The Subscribe screen now has the UI elements (red/green balls) to indicate subscribed/unsubscribed, but
the subscribed state is not being retrieved from the server; I hope only basic event handling enabled to 
show the UI working.

To complete this prototype I need to:

1. query the server to see which nodes are subscribed (event?)

2. complete the Feed screen to display published items

3. make the published schema more dynamic

TO DO:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I finished by adding the Count to the onCreate method, so that the number of published items 
is displayed for each node.

I need to complete this by adding functionality to the publishNode method so that the list 
is refreshed and the count is updated.

NOTE-
I also found defects- can not delete or add more than one- has to do with how I amend the count to the name I believe.
use a custom array adapter and display the count separately.

TO DO:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Publish and Subscribe screens now work adequately.
I've also added 'Delete All Nodes' along with Create Category(Node) to help test and debug.

The Feed screen is now working very basically. I am only displaying the XML for the simple payload.

To complete this prototype I need to:

1. Create an adapter for the FeedList

2. Add basic Settings for I can change the logged in user

3. Make the published payload schema more dynamic- Create the payload XML when you Create the Category node, and use that to draw    
   the UI thats used to collect the data for Category notification.

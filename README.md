AndroidPubSub prototype

TO DO:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Publish and Subscribe screens now work adequately.
I've also added 'Delete All Nodes' along with Create Category(Node) to help testing and debug.

The Feed screen is now working. I am retrieving persistent notifications by pull and push

To complete this prototype I need to:


1. Make the published payload schema more dynamic- Create the payload XML when you Create the Category node, and use that to draw    
   the UI thats used to collect the data for Category notification.
